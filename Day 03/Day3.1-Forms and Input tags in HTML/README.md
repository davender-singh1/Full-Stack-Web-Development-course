## Introduction to HTML Forms
HTML forms are essential for collecting user input on web pages. Whether it's a search bar, a login screen, or a multi-field registration form, HTML forms play a key role in web interactions. They enable users to submit data, which can be processed, stored, or returned by a server.

## Why Do We Use Forms?
Forms serve as the gateway between the user and the server, allowing for dynamic, interactive web experiences. They are crucial for tasks such as user authentication, data submission, feedback collection, and more. Simply put, forms make websites more engaging and functional.

## HTML Forms Structure:
The fundamental structure of an HTML form is encapsulated within the <form> tags. Inside these tags, you'll place various form controls like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons for submitting the form.

## How to Use Form Controls?
The <input> tag is commonly used to create form controls. The attributes of this tag define the control's behavior.

<input type="" name="" value="">

The "type" attribute specifies the type of input control (e.g., text, password, checkbox).

The "name" attribute is used for identifying the control, especially when the data is sent to the server.

The "value" attribute sets a default value for the control, which the user can overwrite.
